// ********* Sturcture and Meaning *************

// 'package' is the folder in which your java file lies.

// 'public' is written, so that this class can be used anywhere.

// 'class' is the collection or group of functions.
// In class the 'functions' are called methods.

// The 'classname' should be equivalent to the file name. 

// The 'public' in second line is for the usability that can be used in any methods.

// 'main' means this function should run first. The program starts from here.

// 'static' means we have to run the program without creating the object of the class.

// 'void' determines the type of value of the return value.
// Here, we do not want any type of value, so it is void.

// 'String[] args' means an argument that stores all the print output in an array.

// In 'println', 'print' is for printing the object and 'ln' is to begin from the new line.'
