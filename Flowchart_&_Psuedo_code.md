## Pseudo code

#### Taking the above Flowcharts and writing them in psuedocode

#### 1st Example:-

```
Start
Input :- Name
Output :- Hello Name
Stop
```

#### 2nd Example:-

```
Start
Input:- Salary
if Salary > 10000:
    Salary + 2000
else:
    Salary + 1000
Output:- Total Salary
Stop
```

#### 3rd Example:-

```
Start
Input:-number
c=2
while c < number:
    if number % c = 0:
        Output:-not prime
    c = c + 1
end while
Output:-prime
Stop
```

#### You can also optimize the 3rd example

Take the different condition in while:-

while c*c < number

This could optimize your code

For example:-

If U have checked 2 * 18 = 36 before in the loop then you do not need to check 18 * 2 = 36 in the loop.
